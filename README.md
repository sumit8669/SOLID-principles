# SOLID-principles
<b> SOLID is an acronym for five design principles for writing maintainable and scalable software.</b><br>
##### The SOLID principles are a set of design principles used in object-oriented programming to help create software systems that are easy to understand, maintain, and extend. The principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (also known as Uncle Bob) in the early 2000s.

## The SOLID acronym stands for


### S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): A class should have only one reason to change.
### O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP): Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification.
### L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP): Subtypes should be substitutable for their base types.
### I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.
### D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions.<br>
##### The SOLID principles are intended to make software designs more modular, flexible, and extensible. They promote the use of abstraction and interfaces, which help to decouple components and reduce dependencies between them.
